# PRAW-API

Barebones discord api wrapper, works for most part apart except its missing functions such as sendings msgs etc can easily be implemented or used as a base,
other wise more optimised than discord.net and anarchy lol

socketclient.cs isn't finished and i don't know if it will be as i cant be bothered atm to finish this, 
things like PRESENCE_UPDATE or USER_UPDATE won't work as they're not implemented but can very easily be fixed by adding literaly 4 lines

might fix it in a future update other wise can be used as a base lol
